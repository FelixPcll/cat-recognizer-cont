# A Cat Breed Recognizer

_(This repository was created because somehow I can't commit any more to my [oldest cat-recognizer repository](https://github.com/FelixPcll/cat-recognizer "Link to old repository"). Please, enjoy the continuation of my work.)_

This project aims to help me to understand how to trains a CNN, prepare the data for it and use the network itself.

The recognition accuracy is clearly reduced because of the volume of data found, which is about 600 pics for each breed, reaching even 400 in some classes.
